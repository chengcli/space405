Magnetic Fields of Planets
--------------------------

Description:

Magnetic fields are an important aspect of planetary science. The magnetic field of a planet
is generated by the motion of the liquid iron core of the planet. The magnetic field of a
planet can protect the planet from the solar wind, which is a stream of charged particles
emitted by the Sun and it tells us about the evolution history of the planet. The
seafloor of the Earth shows linear magnetic stripes that are parallel to the mid-oceanic
ridges. They are the result of the Earth's magnetic field flipping its polarity over geological time.
Mars does not have a global magnetic field, but it has crustal magnetic fields, which are 
remnants of the planet's past magnetic field when the dynamo was active. Europa, a moon of
Jupiter, is believed to host an ocean beneath its icy crust due to the magnetic induction
of Jupiter's varying magnetic field.

1. (5') Magnetic field of Callisto
----------------------------------

Callisto is the outermost Galilean moon of Jupiter. The rocks on Callisto's surface are
billions of years old, which suggests that Callisto has not experienced any geological
activity for a long time. The surface of Callisto is heavily cratered to saturation, meaning
that almost every part of the surface is covered with craters. In fact, Callisto has
the oldest and most heavily cratered surface in the Solar System.

Callisto is composed of a mixture of rock and ice. It is less affected by the magnetic
field of Jupiter and the tidal forces of Jupiter due to its larger distance from Jupiter
compared to the other Galilean moons. Measurements of the density and the moment of inertia
of Callisto suggest that Callisto is an undifferentiated body, meaning that iron, rock and
ice are not separated into layers. The Galileo spacecraft also did not detect an
internally generate magnetic field around Callisto. Given the context above, answer the
following questions:

(1) (2') Please explain why Callisto lasks an internally generated magnetic field

(2) (3') Why are the lacking of an internally generated magnetic field and the heavily cratered
    surface of Callisto consistent with each other?


2. (5') Motion of charged particles in magnetic fields
------------------------------------------------------

We use the unit `ev` to measure the energy of charged particles.
For a non-relativistic particle with velocity v, the kinetic energy of the particle is given by:

.. math::

    KE = \frac{1}{2} \times m \times v^2

where :math:`m` is the mass of the particle. The solar wind contains a stream of charged
particles and many of them are protons and electrons. Suppose that the energy of the
solar wind particles is 1 keV (kilo-electron-volt).

(1) (2') Calculate the velocity of a proton with an energy of 1 keV.

(2) (2') Calculate the velocity of an electron with an energy of 1 keV.

Suppose that the proton hits the magnetic field of Earth and starts to gyrate around the
magnetic field lines. The magnetic field of Earth is approximately 0.5 Gauss. 

(3) (1') What is the maximum radius of the gyration of the proton with a kinetic energy
    of 1 kev around the magnetic field lines of Earth?


3. (10') Magnetic field of Venus
