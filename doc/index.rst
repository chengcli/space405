Textbooks
---------

You will be given reading assignments from the following textbooks. You are not required to purchase them.
Some of them are freely available online, others are available through the U-M library.

Evaluation
----------

You will be evaluated based on your knowledge and skills learned in this course.
The following table shows the weight of each component.
In particular, the scope of the mini-project consists of two parts:

(1) A thorough discussion of your project, including the scientific motivation, 
    the technology, and the impact/results. This part contributes 15% of your total grade.

(2) Your technical report should involve proper formatted examples, figures, tables,
    computer programs, and other visualizations to demonstrate your understanding of
    the project. This part contributes another 15% of your total grade.

The skills you learned during the course and doing the homework assignments will help
you to complete the mini-project. You are encouraged to discuss with the instructor
as early as possible to choose a project that you are interested in.

Basics
~~~~~~

These resources provide general guidelines to prepare you for the
technical aspects of the course. They are modern tools that ease your
effort of writing computer programs and technical documents.
If you are already familiar with them, you can skip this section.
Otherwise, instructions will be given in class when you need to review
the material. You will not be evaluated on learning these materials.
But your homework and mini-project may require you to use them.
